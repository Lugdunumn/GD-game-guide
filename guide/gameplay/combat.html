            <p class="style4">
            As you set out to explore Grim Dawn’s war-ridden world, you will inevitably come upon creatures, and even people, that will seek to harm you. On rare occasions, you will have an opportunity to resolve your differences with diplomacy rather than a blade, but options are limited when a frothing rifthound is pouncing upon you.
            </p>

            <p class="style4">
            Grim Dawn’s fast-paced combat will test your mettle as you face off against seemingly unstoppable Chthonic horrors and aether-warped monstrosities. But before you set out to slaughter the hordes of enemies eager to wipe out the last remnants of humanity, it is important to learn about the mechanics that drive combat.
            </p>

            <p class="style4">
            Armor in Grim Dawn is location-based. Whenever an enemy attacks you with a physical attack or skill, an area on your body will be randomly selected to take the hit. The probability goes as follows:
            </p>

            <div class="style4" style="float: center; width: 50%;">
                <ul  class="b" style="margin-left: 40px;">

            </div>

            <p class="style4">
            What this means is that upgrading your equipment is equally important across all armor slots. Wearing low level leg armor can be tempting if it provides you with beneficial stats, but it can also spell your doom if a particularly strong attack lands on your legs.
            </p>

            <br>

            <a name="q03"></a>
            <span class="style2">Landing Hits and Critical Hits</span>
            <p class="style4">
            The ability to hit and critically hit is directly tied to your <span class="highlight">Offensive Ability (OA)</span> and your target’s <span class="highlight">Defensive Ability (DA).</span> When your OA is higher than your opponent’s DA, your chance to hit and even critically hit will increase.
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            As you continue to gain more bonuses to your OA, you will reach higher critical multipliers. The highest possible critical multiplier is x3.5, but to achieve this threshold you must either significantly out-level your target or have invested heavily in your OA.
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            Both weapon attacks and abilities rely on OA to hit and critically hit, so OA is an important attribute for any character. Offensive Ability and Defensive Ability can be increased through Cunning and Physique, respectively, and directly through equipment and skills.
            </p>

            <br>

            <a name="q04"></a>
            <span class="style2">% Weapon Damage</span>
            <p class="style4">
            As you discover new abilities, you will eventually stumble upon skills that deal % Weapon Damage. What this means is that the skill takes the damage and effects you would deal on a regular attack and multiplies it by the displayed %. This includes things such as life steal, bonus magical damage and chance on attack item skills.
            </p>
            <p class="style4"><i>
            Example: 125% Weapon Damage on a skill will take your basic attack and multiply it by x1.25
            </i></p>

            <br>
			
            <a name="q05"></a>
            <span class="style2">Flat vs. Percent Damage</span>
            <p class="style4">
            Damage on equipment comes in two forms: Flat Damage and Percent Damage. Flat Damage applies only to your weapon attacks and does not increase the damage from your skills unless they include a % Weapon Damage component. If found on a weapon, the Flat Damage bonus applies only to that weapon.
            </p>
			<p class="style4">
            Percent Damage bonuses affect all damage dealt of that type, which includes skills and weapon attacks. So if you have a 20% bonus to Fire Damage, all of your fire-based skills will do increased damage, as well as any fire damage you deal on weapon attacks.
            </p>

            <br>
			
            <a name="q06"></a>
            <span class="style2">Elemental Damage</span>
            <p class="style4">
            Elemental Damage is a combination of the three basic magical elements: Fire, Ice and Lightning. When it appears as flat damage, Elemental Damage will be dealt as 1/3 Fire + 1/3 Ice + 1/3 Lightning, divided equally.
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            Percent Elemental Damage on the other hand is a bonus to all three elements equal to the full value. It is not split evenly. This makes percent Elemental Damage a powerful way to increase several damage types at once.
            </p>

            <br>
			
            <a name="q07"></a>
            <span class="style2">% Current Life Damage</span>
            <p class="style4">
            Percent Current Life Damage is dealt as a fraction of the monster's current health. This causes Percent Current Life damage to be less effective the closer to death the target is. The damage is not a temporary reduction to the target's maximum health.
            </p>
            <p class="style4"><i>
            Note that Hero and Boss Monsters have a high resistance to this damage type.
            </i></p>

            <a name="q08"></a>
            <span class="style2">Life Steal</span>
            <p class="style4">
            Percent of Attack Damage Converted to Health is a form of life steal available in Grim Dawn. It functions differently depending on whether you find it on equipment or on a skill. When on equipment, life steal applies only to your weapon attacks. If you use a skill with % Weapon Damage, that component of the skill benefit from the life steal.
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            When found on a skill, Percent of Attack Damage Converted to Health applies to all of that skill's damage.
            </p>

            <span class="style2">Passively Activated Weapon Skills</span>
            <p class="style4">
            Some abilities in Grim Dawn are passively activated on your basic attacks. The Soldier and Nightblade masteries provide several examples of this. Each of these abilities has a chance to activate, which is displayed as a percentage. What that means is that on every basic attack you do, you will have a chance of using the ability instead.
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            As you invest in these skills, their chance of activation will increase. It is possible to get the total chance of activating passive weapon abilities to go beyond 100%. When this occurs, all of your basic attacks will be replaced by abilities and their chances of activation will be used to determine their relative frequency.
            </p>

            <p class="style4">
            Shields are the definitive defensive option for the off-hand. When you are struck by an attack with a shield equipped, you will have a chance to block some of the damage (shields can block any damage type). When this occurs, you will be unable to block again until the shield’s Block Recovery time has expired. This cooldown can be reduced through various skills and equipment.
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            Some abilities can use the shield when striking, rather than your weapon. In this case, the % Weapon Damage component of the ability will use the shield’s damage rather than your main-hand.

            <p class="style4">
            There are many ways in Grim Dawn with which you can lock down your target’s ability to react to you. These effects are known as crowd control. The following are the various effects players (and monsters) can use to get advantage in battle:
            </p>

            <div class="style4" style="float: center; width: 80%;">

                    <li class="a"><span class="style8">Freeze -</span> This effect prevents all actions for its duration.</li>
                    <li class="a"><span class="style8">Petrify -</span> This effect prevents all actions for its duration.</li>
                    <li class="a"><span class="style8">Knockdown -</span> This effect sends the target flying and crumbling to the ground. The target will stand back up at the end of its duration. Players are immune to knockdowns.</li>
                    <li class="a"><span class="style8">Trap -</span> This effect immobilizes the target for its duration. It is particularly strong against melee monsters.</li>
                    <li class="a"><span class="style8">Confusion -</span> This effect causes the target to wander aimlessly for its duration. Players are immune to confusion.</li>
                    <li class="a"><span class="style8">Fear -</span> This effect causes the target to flee from the caster for its duration. Players are immune to fear.</li>
                    <li class="a"><span class="style8">Sleep -</span> This effect prevents all actions for its duration, but will end early if the target takes damage.</li>
                    <li class="a"><span class="style8">Convert -</span> This effect causes the target to fight on your side for its duration. Players are immune to convert.</li>
                    <li class="a"><span class="style8">Slow -</span> This effect reduces the attack speed, cast speed, move speed or a combination of all three of the target for its duration.</li>

            <p class="style4">
            There are many effects in Grim Dawn which can be applied through several different sources. Whenever this occurs, the strongest effect always takes precedence. For example, if two players in a multiplayer session have the same aura active, the player who invested more skill points into the aura will have theirs take effect while the other player’s will not apply its bonuses.
            </p>
            <div style="height: 44px; width: 60px; float: left; margin-top: 5px"><img src="../../webfiles/guide/gd_guideDebuff01.jpg" alt="missing" class="centered" title="debuff"></div>
            <p class="style4">
            This works similarly for debuffs and damage over time effects. If you apply a % reduction to a monster’s damage by using a skill and then do the same thing with a weapon attack, only the strongest debuff will be take effect. The effects do not stack. Likewise, a target will only take damage from the strongest damage over time effect, such as burn damage.
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            In the case that a strong effect has a shorter duration than a weaker effect, the weaker effect will become active once the stronger effect expires.

            Constitution is a secondary health regeneration system which activates outside of combat. It is represented by a yellow overlay on your health bar. Whenever Constitution activates, your Constitution pool will be drained as your health rapidly refills. If you run out of Constitution, you will no longer rapidly regenerate health outside of combat. To exit combat, you must avoid dealing or taking damage for 2.5 seconds.

            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            Some pets last for only a few seconds, while others can be summoned indefinitely. Some pets can also be issued direct commands, such as to attack a specific target or to move to a specific location. These pets will have their health status displayed in the upper left of the screen. Controllable pets have three stances: Normal, Defensive and Aggressive.

            The enemies of humanity are relentless, but there are many methods available to keep yourself alive. It is important to know how the various levels of defense stack up. In order for an attack to land, it must make it through the following defenses:
            </p>

            <div class="style4" style="float: center; width: 80%;">
                <ul  class="a">

                </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="style4">
            Because shields absorb damage only after it has gone through all your other defenses, they can be a very powerful tool in your survival and should not be underestimated.
            </p>

            <br>

            <a name="q18"></a>
            <span class="style2">Armor Formula</span>
            <p class="style4">
            It suffices to say that the more armor you have, the less physical damage you will take, but there are some rules as to how armor functions which make it a little deeper than that.
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            Armor in Grim Dawn has both a defense value and an absorption value. By default, your armor absorption is 70% across all your equipment. Whenever you take a physical damage hit, your armor will absorb some of the damage, up to the armor value in the targeted equipment slot. However, armor can only protect you from a percentage of the damage equal to your armor absorption. The rest always goes through.
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            Some examples:
            </p>

            <div class="style4" style="float: center; width: 80%;">
                <ul  class="a">
                    <li class="a">You are attacked for <span class="highlight">100</span> damage and the attack hits you in the torso, which has <span class="highlight">50</span> armor. In this case, you will take <span class="highlight">50</span> damage. Your armor can absorb up to <span class="highlight">70</span> of the damage <span class="highlight">(70% of 100)</span>, but your torso only has <span class="highlight">50</span> armor.</li>
                    <li class="a">You are attacked for <span class="highlight">100</span> damage and the attack hits you in the head, which has <span class="highlight">124</span> armor. In this case, you will take <span class="highlight">30</span> damage. Even though your armor is higher than the damage inflicted, <span class="highlight">30%</span> of the damage will always go through.</li>
                    <li class="a">You are attacked for <span class="highlight">100</span> damage and the attack hits you in the head, which has <span class="highlight">124</span> armor, but this time you also have a <span class="highlight">20%</span> bonus to armor absorption on your helmet. In this case, you will take 16 damage. Your armor absorption is <span class="highlight">70% * 1.2, or 84%,</span> which allowed you to absorb <span class="highlight">84</span> damage from the blow.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <br>

            <a name="q19"></a>
            <span class="style2">Offensive vs Defensive Ability Formula</span>
            <p class="style4">
            <span class="highlight">Offensive Ability (OA)</span> and <span class="highlight">Defensive Ability (DA)</span> are critical to both your ability to deal out damage and in your own survival. If you let your Offensive Ability fall behind as you level, you will find that more and more of your attacks will miss. Similarly, an insufficient Defensive Ability will result in your enemies not only landing blows more frequently but also sometimes landing devastating critical hits. The relationship between Offensive and Defensive Ability is handled through the following equation:
            </p>

            <p class="style4"><i>
            Probability To Hit (PTH) = ((((Attacker’s OA * 5) + 5000) – (Defender’s DA *5)) / 50) – 15
            </i></p>

            <p class="style4">
            The value resulting from this calculation is your chance to strike the target. You may notice that it is feasible for this chance to go over 100. This is where the critical multiplier thresholds come in.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p class="style3">
            PTH Threshold 1: 75 (1.0 damage)
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            If your PTH is lower than 75, any attacks that land will do reduced damage. The damage reduction multiplier is equal to your PTH / 75 (ex. if your PTH is 70, you will do 93.33% of normal damage on a hit, or 70/75). It is highly uncommon to go below a PTH of 75, though it can happen against targets that are significantly higher level than you.
            </p>
            <p class="style4"><i>
            Example: PTH = 70, 1-70 hits for 93.33% damage, 71-100 misses
            </i></p>

            <p class="style3">
            PTH Threshold 2: 90 (1.5x damage)
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            When your PTH reaches 90 and beyond, you will begin to see critical hits.
            </p>
            <p class="style4"><i>
            Example: PTH = 97, 1-90 hits, 91-97 critically hits for 1.5x damage, 98-100 misses
            </i></p>

            <p class="style3">
            PTH Threshold 3: 105 (2.0x damage)
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            At PTH 100 and above, you cannot miss your target. At PTH 105+, you will begin to see the second tier of critical hits.
            </p>
            <p class="style4"><i>
            Example: PTH = 110, 1-90 hits, 91-105 critically hits for 1.5x damage, 106-110 critically hits for 2x damage
            </i></p>

            <p class="style3">
            PTH Threshold 4: 125 (2.5x damage)
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            At PTH 125 and above, you will begin to see the third tier of critical hits.
            </p>
            <p class="style4"><i>
            Example: PTH = 132, 1-90 hits, 91-105 critically hits for 1.5x damage, 106-125 critically hits for 2x damage, 126-132 critically hits for 2.5x damage
            </i></p>

            <p class="style3">
            PTH Thresholds 5 and 6: 145 (3.0x damage) and 165 (3.5x damage)
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            This pattern continues for the final two tiers of critical hits.  Beyond the 6th threshold, you will no longer see higher critical hit values, but you will see critical hits more reliably.
            </p>

            <br>

            <a name="q20"></a>
            <span class="style2">Conversion</span>
            <p class="style4">
            Conversion is a special stat found on equipment and skills that changes one damage type to another. The way it behaves is different depending on whether it modifies a skill or is found on a piece of equipment.
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            If you have an amulet with 10% of physical damage converted to fire, that means that 10% of all physical damage you deal (regardless of source) will be dealt as fire instead. This calculation is done after any bonuses you receive to physical damage from Cunning, skills and equipment. What that means is that you cannot increase damage resulting from conversion directly (ex. fire damage converted from physical damage cannot be increased by Spirit or % Fire Damage).
            </p>
            <p class="style4">
            If you have a skill, such as a Transmuter, that converts the damage your attack does, then this calculation is performed before any bonuses from other skills, attributes or equipment are considered. Skill modifiers are still applied first. What this means is that if you take a skill that normally deals Aether damage and use Conversion to make it deal Chaos damage instead, then the skill will benefit from % Chaos Damage bonuses instead of % Aether Damage bonuses.
