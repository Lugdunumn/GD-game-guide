            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">

            Grim Dawn is an action-RPG for the PC currently being developed by veterans of Iron Lore Entertainment, the creators of Titan Quest. The game is set in a thematically-dark fictional world loosely inspired by the Victorian Era on earth.  Grim Dawn is being developed with the same tools and technology used to create Titan Quest. As a spiritual successor to Titan Quest, Grim Dawn will carry forward the best gameplay of this genre while bringing a few focused innovations and improvements of our own to the table.

            <span class="style2">Is Grim Dawn based in history / mythology?</span>
            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">

            No, Grim Dawn is set in a unique fictional world that is loosely inspired by the Victorian Era but is not meant to actually take place on Earth, mythological or otherwise. A lot of effort has gone into the development of a deep story-world with a rich history, unique characters and intriguing subplots. The setting will be &#8220;thematically&#8221; darker in terms of mood and environment but, don&#39;t worry, unlike many games set in post-apocalyptic style worlds, Grim Dawn won&#39;t be a burnt out, gray wasteland.

            <span class="style2">Where can I buy Grim Dawn and how much will it cost?</span>
            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">

            Grim Dawn can be purchased on our site via the webstore powered by Humble Bundle or on Steam. We have not yet determined what the final price will be at release. It all depends on what the finished content and what we feel is a good value for that.
            </p>
            
            <br><br>
            <a name="q05"></a>
            <span class="style2">What is this talk of downloadable content?</span>
            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">

            When many people hear the term downloadable content they are filled with fear and rage. They imagine having to charge $0.50 to their credit cards everytime they buy a new item.  This is not what we imagine. This is a downloadable game, so it makes sense that when we release expansion packs, they will also be downloadable. These expansions will be similar to a normal boxed game-expansion in that they will generally contain new story elements, classes, enemies, items, and new regions of the world to explore.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            

            <a name="q06"></a>
            <span class="style2">Does Grim Dawn have multiplayer?</span>
            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">

            Absolutely! You will be able to group up with family and friends to take on the world of Grim Dawn just as you could in Titan Quest. In addition, we intend to release high-end areas that will provide an extra level of challenge.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <span class="style2" >How do character classes work?</span>
            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">

            Grim Dawn features 5 skill classes, each containing several skill trees.  Additional skill classes will be introduced through downloadable add-ons. Players will be able to combine any two skill classes to explore powerful synergies that exist between the skill trees of different classes and experience the varying gameplay styles of each class build. It will be impossible to max out all the skills from two classes, so there will be plenty of experimentation to find the best way to allocate your points. Don&#39;t worry though, if you aren&#39;t satisfied with your build, you will be able to spend in-game currency to reclaim spent skill points.
            </p>

            <span class="style2">Does Grim Dawn have tons of sweet loot?</span>
            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">

            Does a bear shit in the woods?! We have made many improvements to our item drop and randomization system with far more custom-crafted magical, rare, and even unique bonuses. We have also made several improvements to the loot dropping system to ensure more consistent rewards and less junk cluttering up the screen / inventory. Last but certainly not least, Grim Dawn features a new item crafting system based off collectible recipes and rare crafting components that drop in the world.
            </p>

            <span class="style2">If I buy from your website, can I still play on Steam?</span>
            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">

            Yes, you will receive an Early Access Steam key for Grim Dawn through Humble Store.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <span class="style2">Does Grim Dawn use DRM that TOTALLY screws me over?!</span>
            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">

            No, you can purchase from our website through Humble Store and then download a DRM-free version from them. You won't have to go online to activate it once you've downloaded it. We only authenticate game-keys when / if you log into a multiplayer match-making service.  You can play single player or LAN offline.
            </p>

            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">
            Grim Dawn is still in development and so full release copies are not yet available for download. However, everyone who purchases a copy through our website will also receive a key for a Steam's Early Access copy of Grim Dawn, which you can use to play the game as it is being developed.
            </p>

            <p class="style4">
            Your full release key will enable you to download the applicable version of Grim Dawn as soon as it is released. Once that happens, you can be certain that we will make a big deal about announcing it. You can be sure to recieve updates by following us on Twitter or Facebook. We will also email all key-holders to let them know the game is ready to download.
            </p>

            <span class="style2">So when is this game going to be done?</span>
            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">
            After all the blood and sweat we've invested in this game, we don't want to rush something out the door before it is ready. I think we all want this game to be a success, so ultimately, we can only say that it will be done when it is done. So please be patient with us; it will all pay off in the end!
            </p>

            <p class="style4">
            For those that wish to see the game progress to its full release, Grim Dawn is now available on Steam's Early Access. 
            </p>

            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">
            No, you'll be able to play single-player offline or LAN multiplayer. Internet is only required for the initial download and installation or for internet multiplayer matchmaking.

            <hr class="hr">
            <p class="style4">
            We haven't yet determined the exact minimum requirements and they may change prior to the final release. Different phases of release such as alpha and beta may also have different requirements than the final release as we will not have full optimized the game or spent time fixing compatibility issues. For that reason, we can't guarantee that alpha or beta will run on all machines, even if they meet our estimation for the minimum specifications.</p>
